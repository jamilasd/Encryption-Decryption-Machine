# Encryption-Decryption-Machine

This encryption machine takes in a string message and converts it into an encrypted message to be sent to the recipient. The recipient, once the message is received can then use the decryption machine to convert the message back to a readable string.

# Jupyter Notebook: 
To run the encryption decryption machine in a Jupyter notebook, please download the following files in the same folder:
- encryption.ipynb
- decryption.ipynb
- encryption_image.png
- decryption_image.png

Next, open the encryption.ipynb and decryption.ipynb. Run all of the cells of the encryption file in succession. Copy the output encryption list to clipboard and then run all of the cells in the decryption file in succession. (i.e. [60, 31, 207, 207, 19, 34, 40, 13, 77, 40, 131, 1, 13, 31, 40, 42, 15,40, 108, 1, 13, 42, 207, 1]) You will be prompted to input the encryption list, so if you didn't copy it from the encryption file then please restart & run all cells in the encryption file again. 

# Terminal Window:
To run the encryption decryption machine in a terminal window, please download the following files in the same folder:
- encryption.py
- decryption.py

Open a new terminal window and run the encryption.py file by typing: 
   >>> python encryption.py

You will be prompted to input some numbers and message that you want to encrypt. Copy the encryption list to clipboard. (i.e. [60, 31, 207, 207, 19, 34, 40, 13, 77, 40, 131, 1, 13, 31, 40, 42, 15,40, 108, 1, 13, 42, 207, 1]) Next, run the decryption.py file by typing:
   >>> python decryption.py
 
You will be prompted to input the encryption list you copied earlier, so if you didn't copy it from the encryption file then please scroll up and copy the list above. 

The output for both the Jupyer run decryption program and the Terminal run decryption program should be identical to the message that was provided in the encryption machine.
